### Seven-segment display decoder

1. Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file (`tb_hex_7seg.vhd`) with asserts. Verify all input combinations. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

```vhdl
    p_stimulus : process
    begin
        report "Stimulus process started" severity note;

        -- First test case
        s_hex <= "0000"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0000001")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "0001"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "1001111")
        report "Input combination 0001 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "0010"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0010010")
        report "Input combination 0010 FAILED" severity error;
        
	s_hex <= "0011"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0000110")
        report "Input combination 0011 FAILED" severity error;
        
	s_hex <= "0100"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "1001100")
        report "Input combination 0100 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "0101"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0100100")
        report "Input combination 0101 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "0110"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0100000")
        report "Input combination 0110 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "0111"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0001111")
        report "Input combination 0111 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "1000"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0000000")
        report "Input combination 1000 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "1001"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0000100")
        report "Input combination 1001 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "1010"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0001000")
        report "Input combination 1010 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "1011"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "1100000")
        report "Input combination 1011 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "1100"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0110001")
        report "Input combination 1100 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "1101"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "1000010")
        report "Input combination 1101 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "1110"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0110000")
        report "Input combination 1110 FAILED" severity error;
        
        s_hex <= "1111"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0111000")
        report "Input combination 1111 FAILED" severity error;


        report "Stimulus process finished" severity note;
        wait;
    end process p_stimulus;
```

2. Screenshot with simulated time waveforms. Always display all inputs and outputs (display the inputs at the top of the image, the outputs below them) at the appropriate time scale!

### LED(7:4) indicators

1. Listing of LEDs(7:4) part of VHDL architecture from source file `top.vhd`. Try to write logic functions as simple as possible. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

   ```vhdl
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
	LED(4) <= `1` when (s_hex = 0) else '0';

	LED(5) <= '1' when (s_hex > 1001) else '0';
    
	LED(6) <= '1' when (s_hex(0) = 0) else '0';

	--LED(7)
        case s_hex is
            when "0001" =>
               	LED(7) <= '1'
            when "0010" =>
               	LED(7) <= '1'
            when "0100" =>
               	LED(7) <= '1'
            when "1000" =>
               	LED(7) <= '1'
            when others =>
               	LED(7) <= '0'
        end case;
   ```
